    <h1>Computer Software</h1>

    <p>
        Software consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer. 
        Software also includes design documents and specifications.
        The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. 
        Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. 
        The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 allowed for more human-readable instructions, 
        making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures. 
        Software in a programming language is run through a compiler or interpreter to execute on the architecture's hardware. 
        Over time, software has become complex, owing to developments in networking, operating systems, and databases.

            <h2>Operating system</h2>
            <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
                Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time,
                mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.
                For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,
                although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. 
                Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.</p>

            <h2>Application software</h2>
            <p>Application software is any computer program that is intended for end-user use - not operating, administering or programming the computer. 
                An application (app, application program, software application) is any program that can be categorized as application software. Common types of applications include word processor, media player and accounting software.
                The term application software refers to all applications collectively and can be used to differentiate from system and utility software.
                Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately. Applications may be proprietary or open-source.</p>
